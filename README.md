# Scheme-Interpreter-Project

This is a Scheme interpreter made in C. This was originally a school project that focused on what constituted a programming languages and how they work underneath the hood. Essentially, this is a program that runs code from the functional programming Scheme. It is limited and does include all built-in Scheme functions, but it includes many major ones!
